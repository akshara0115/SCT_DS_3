# Decision Tree Classifier with SMOTE and Grid Search
## Overview
Welcome to the repository for my third project at SkillCraft Technologies! This project involves building and evaluating a Decision Tree Classifier with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning. The aim is to improve the prediction of customer purchase behavior based on a bank marketing dataset.
## Project Description
### Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from a bank marketing campaign. It contains various features such as customer age, job, marital status, education, and more. The target variable is whether the customer has subscribed to a term deposit.
### Steps and Methodology
1. *Data Exploration:* Initial analysis to understand the dataset's structure and identify key features.
2. *Data Cleaning and Encoding:* Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
3. *Data Balancing:* Applying SMOTE to address class imbalance in the target variable.
4. *Model Training:* Training a Decision Tree Classifier with optimized hyperparameters using Grid Search.
5. *Model Evaluation:* Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. *Visualization:* Creating visualizations to communicate the findings effectively.
## Results
### Model Performance
- *Accuracy:* 0.84
- *Classification Report:* 
  - Precision: 0.94 (No Purchase), 0.40 (Purchase)
  - Recall: 0.88 (No Purchase), 0.57 (Purchase)
  - F1-Score: 0.91 (No Purchase), 0.47 (Purchase)
- *Confusion Matrix:* 
  - [[7001  951]
  - [ 467  624]]
